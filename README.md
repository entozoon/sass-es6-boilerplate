# Sass ES6 Boilerplate

This is a quick starting point for a flat site with Sass and ES6 compilation. Nothing fancy.

## "Why do you keep making these, Myke? Every day you stray further from God's light!"

I whip up this junk every other day and it's boring to debug the package scripts, so might as well pop a boilerplate here for reference.

## "Why not use Webpack?"

Simplicity. But you certainly could, and possibly should, as it'd be capable of things that this isn't, such as:

- Require/imports in JS
- HTML minification
- Asset compilation

## Install

    npm i

## Run

    npm start
